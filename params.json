  "body": "### An R package for X-Wide Association Analyses\r\n\r\nThe `xwas` package was originally developed from research done in the exposome lab of the Department for Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School.\r\n\r\n### User Quickstart\r\n\r\nWe are working on a submission of this package to CRAN and hope future installations will be the simple 1-liner below from within R. However, this is currently *NOT* a viable method of installing the `xwas` package.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# NOT CURRENTLY VIABLE!\r\n> install.packages(\"xwas\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstalling `xwas` using the source code from Github within R.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Install and load the devtools package\r\n> install.packages(\"devtools\")\r\n> library(devtools)\r\n\r\n# Download and install the latest stable xwas version from Github\r\n> install_github('chiragjp/xwas')\r\n\r\n# Load the xwas library\r\n> library(xwas)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### For Developers\r\n\r\nThis method is for active contributors to `xwas` and developers who want the latest version in development. It requires cloning the source code from Github and building the package locally using the `Makefile` in a Terminal before loading `xwas` in R.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Grab the bleeding edge source\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:nampho2/xwas.git\r\n\r\n# Build the R package in the cloned directory\r\n$ cd xwas\r\n$ make deploy\r\n\r\n$ R\r\n\r\n# Load the xwas library\r\n> library(xwas)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nThe xwas package was originally authored by @chiragjp and currently maintained by @nampho2.\r\n\r\nPlease e-mail the current package <a href=\"mailto:nam_pho@hms.harvard.edu\">maintainer</a> with any questions.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n1. asdf\r\n2. asdf\r\n",
