  "body": "### An R package for X-Wide Association Analyses\r\n\r\nThe `xwas` package was originally developed from research done in the exposome lab of the Department for Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School. \r\n\r\nDuring the course of investigation on the behavioral and environmental causes of mortality we found that studies have historically only evaluated one or a few hand-picked factors. This approach lacks the rigor of a systematic approach found in other data sciences and the lack of standardization in analytical approach can lead to spurious results. In some fields such as genomics, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have resulted in a robust body of reproducible findings and we sought to take an analogous approach to environmentally- and behaviorally-based studies. This easy-to-use package provided here is a much needed framework to extend the Cox proportional hazards regression based approach to a more generalized audience.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: this package is provided as-is and we are not responsible for any issue resulting from is use. \r\n\r\n### User Quickstart\r\n\r\nWe are working on a submission of this package to CRAN and hope future installations will be the simple 1-liner below from within R. However, this is currently *NOT* a viable method of installing the `xwas` package.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# From CRAN\r\n> install.packages(\"xwas\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstalling `xwas` using the source code from Github within R.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Install and load the devtools package\r\n> install.packages(\"devtools\")\r\n> library(devtools)\r\n\r\n# Download and install the latest stable xwas version from Github\r\n> install_github('chiragjp/xwas')\r\n\r\n# Load the xwas library\r\n> library(xwas)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### For Developers\r\n\r\nThis method is for active contributors to `xwas` and developers who want the latest version in development. It requires cloning the source code from Github and building the package locally using the `Makefile` in a Terminal before loading `xwas` in R.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Grab the bleeding edge source\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:nampho2/xwas.git\r\n\r\n# Build the R package in the cloned directory\r\n$ cd xwas\r\n$ make deploy\r\n\r\n$ R\r\n\r\n# Load the xwas library\r\n> library(xwas)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Using the Package\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata(nhanes)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nThe xwas package was originally authored by @chiragjp and currently maintained by @nampho2.\r\n\r\nPlease e-mail the current package <a href=\"mailto:nam_pho@hms.harvard.edu\">maintainer</a> with any questions.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n1.
